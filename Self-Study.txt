1.If you were to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?
	
	Semantic HTML is meaningful mark-up. It is separating items, while being as specific as posible (grouping like things together, going with sections or paragraphs instead of spans and div, etc.)

2. Name two big differences between display: block; and display: inline;

	Block displays are things that create new lines, like paragraphs. Inline displays do not create a new line, like spans. Block displays take up as much space as possible, inline displays only take up as much space as needed.

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?
	
	Margins, content, borders, and padding

4. While using flexbox, what axis does the following property work on: align-items: center?
	
	The cross (vertical) axis.
	

5.Explain why git is valuable to a team of developers.

	Git makes original code freely available to all developers. It is version-controlled, so content is constantly updated. Though the content changes, Git stores revisions and original code. This means if something goes wrong, we can easily revert to the previous version and work out fixes. Because everything is stored in the cloud, it is also a good tool for collaboration between developers.
